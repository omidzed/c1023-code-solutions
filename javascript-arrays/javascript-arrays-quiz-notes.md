## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What are arrays used for?
Arrays in JavaScript are used for storing multiple values in a single variable. Think of them like a list of items. Instead of having separate variables to hold related data, you can group them together in an array. This makes it easier to organize, access, and manipulate your data.

- Describe array literal notation.
Array literals look like this:
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

- How are arrays different from "plain" objects?
Arrays are specialized objects with ordered, numerically indexed elements and built-in methods for manipulation, while "plain" objects have named properties and lack the array-specific methods and behavior.

- What number represents the first index of an array?
0

- What is the `length` property of an array?
The length property of an array in JavaScript tells you the number of elements in the array. It's super useful when you're looping through arrays or when you want to know how many items are in an array.

- How do you calculate the last index of an array?
array.length - 1
