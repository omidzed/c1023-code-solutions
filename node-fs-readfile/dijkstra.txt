import { readFile } from 'node:fs/promises';

Simplicity is a great virtue but it requires hard work to achieve it and education to appreciate it. And to make matters worse: complexity sells better.



const fs = require('fs').promises;

async function readFileContents() {
    try {
        // Read the contents of the file
        const data = await fs.readFile('dijkstra.txt', 'utf-8');
        console.log(data);
    } catch (error) {
        // Handle any errors that occur during reading
        console.error('Error reading file:', error);
    }
}

readFileContents();
