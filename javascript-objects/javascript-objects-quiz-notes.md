## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What are objects used for?
Objects are used to store keyed collections of various data and more complex entities. In JavaScript, objects penetrate almost every aspect of the language.

- What are object properties?
A property has a key (also known as “name” or “identifier”) before the colon ":" and a value to the right of it.
And property values can pretty much be anything from javascript (an object or any data type can fit its scheme)

- Describe object literal notation.
Object literal notation is where ever we see {} type of brackets. So an object literal would look like:
const obj = {};
as opposed to
const obj = new Object();

- How do you remove a property from an object?
by using delete, so like this:
delete obj.property;

- What are the two ways to get or update the value of a property?
dot notation and bracket notation.
