## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a CLI?

  A Command Line Interface (CLI) is a text-based interface used to interact with software and operating systems. Users type commands into a terminal or console window, and the system executes those commands. CLI is preferred for tasks that require precision, scripting, or system-level control.

  What is a GUI?

- What is a GUI?
  A Graphical User Interface (GUI) is an interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons and visual indicators, as opposed to text-based interfaces, typed command labels, or text navigation. GUIs are more user-friendly and are commonly used in personal computers, mobile devices, and other electronic appliances.

- Give at least one use case for each of the commands listed in this exercise.

  - `man`
    Provides a manual or detailed documentation about other commands or programs. For example, man ls shows detailed information about the ls command.

  - `cat`
    Concatenates and displays the content of files. It can be used to quickly view file contents or combine multiple files into one.

  - `ls`
    Lists the contents of a directory. It's commonly used to view the files and subdirectories in the current directory.

  - `pwd`
    Prints the current working directory path. It's helpful to confirm your current directory in the filesystem.

  - `echo`
    Outputs the strings it is given to the terminal. It can be used for displaying a string of text, variable values, or to append content to a file.

  - `touch`
    Creates a new empty file or updates the timestamp of an existing file. It's often used to quickly create a new file.

  - `mkdir`
    Creates a new directory. Useful for organizing files into different folders.

  - `mv`
    Moves or renames files and directories. For example, it can be used to rename a file or move it to a different directory.

  - `rm`
    Removes files or directories. It's a command for deleting files or directories from the filesystem.

  - `cp`
    Copies files and directories. It can be used to make a copy of a file or an entire directory.

- What are the three virtues of a great programmer?
  According to Larry Wall, the creator of Perl, the three virtues of a great programmer are Laziness, Impatience, and Hubris;
  Laziness: The quality that makes you go to great effort to reduce overall energy expenditure. It makes you write labor-saving programs that other people will find useful and document what you wrote so you don't have to answer so many questions about it.
  Impatience: The anger you feel when the computer is being lazy. This makes you write programs that don't just react to your needs but actually anticipate them.
  Hubris: The quality that makes you write (and maintain) programs that other people wonâ€™t want to say bad things about. It implies the writing of clean, readable, and maintainable code.
  These virtues are somewhat tongue-in-cheek but highlight important aspects of a programmer's mindset: efficiency, foresight, and pride in one's work.
