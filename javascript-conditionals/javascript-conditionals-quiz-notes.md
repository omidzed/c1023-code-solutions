&&, || , ! and ??

- How do you compare two different expressions in the same condition?
with the && operator

- What is the purpose of a `switch` statement?
Switch statements come in handy when there are many many cases/conditions that we want to check in our conditional statement, whereas if/else and the like are usually dealing with a few conditions being checked or comapred.
Also in switch statements the developer can set up each case to perform some action, such as consoe.log() something, even though that is not the main condition or case that we were searching for, whereas in if/else conditionals typically either one thing happens, or nothing happens.
Finally, the default clause is another feature of switch statements that if/else does not.

- Is a `default` clause required in order to use a `switch` statement?
No
