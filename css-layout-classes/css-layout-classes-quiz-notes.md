## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- Why do two div elements "vertically stack" on one another by default?
Because they are block level elements, which means they take up the entire width by default, which they inherit from their parent element and whatever width they had.

- What is the default `flex-direction` of an element with `display: flex`?
Row

- What are the three primary components of a page layout? (Which helper classes do you need?)
Header, Body, Footer

- What is the minimum number of **columns** that you should put in a **row**?
1

- What is the purpose of a **container**?
Container is a good starting point for displaya:flex to get used, as it gets setup as the parents element, which then begins a decision tree of which elements are the container's children and how they will behave, and how theh children of those elements will behave and so on. This concept is very key in flexbox.
