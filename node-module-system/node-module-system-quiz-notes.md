## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a JavaScript module?
  A JavaScript module is a way to organize and encapsulate code, allowing you to break up your JavaScript into separate, reusable pieces. Each module is a file containing related functions, variables, classes, or other code, which can be exported and then imported into other modules. This keeps the global namespace clean and makes the code easier to maintain and understand.

- What are the advantages of modular programming?
  Maintainability: Modules allow you to organize code logically, making it easier to maintain. Changes in one module are less likely to impact others.
  Reusability: Functions or classes defined in a module can be reused across different parts of your application.
  Namespacing: Modules help avoid naming collisions by encapsulating variables and functions.
  Scalability: Large codebases are more manageable when broken down into smaller, modular units.
  Ease of Testing: Smaller modules are easier to test and debug.

- In JavaScript, how do you make a function in a module available to other modules?
  Export functions, objects, or primitives from a module using the export keyword.

- In JavaScript, how do you use a function from another module?
  To use a function from another module, you need to import it using the import keyword.
