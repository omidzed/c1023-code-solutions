## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a **breakpoint** in responsive Web design?
A breakpoint is like a marker in responsive web design. It's used to define certain points where the website's layout should change to fit different screen sizes.

- What is the advantage of using a percentage (_e.g._ `50%`) width instead of a fixed (_e.g._ `px`) width for a "column" class in a responsive layout?
Using a percentage width (like 50%) for elements such as a column makes your layout more fluid and adaptable to different screen sizes.

- If you introduce CSS rules for a smaller `min-width` _after_ the styles for a larger `min-width` in your style sheet, the CSS rules for the **smaller** `min-width` will "win". Why is that?
CSS works on a principle where the latest rule or the most specific rule gets priority.
