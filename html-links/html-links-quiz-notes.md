## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What HTML tag is used to link to another website?
<a>

- What is an absolute URL?
Points to a location defined by its absolute location on the web, including protocol and domain name. An absolute URL will always point to the same location, no matter where it's used. Example:
https://www.example.com

- What is a relative URL?
Points to a location that is relative to the file you are linking from. A relative URL will point to different places depending on the actual location of the file you refer from â€” for example if we moved our index.html file out of the projects directory and into the root of the website, the path we put in our <a> must be changed or the link will fail to work.
