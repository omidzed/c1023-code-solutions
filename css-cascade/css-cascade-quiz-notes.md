## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What are the four components of "the Cascade".
Source Order, Inheritance, Specificity & !important

- What does the term "source order" mean with respect to CSS?
the order that your CSS rules are written in your stylesheet. The styling provided for an element last in your stylesheet is the styling that will ultimately take effect.

- How is it possible for the styles of an element to be applied to its children as well without an additional CSS rule?
Inheritance

- List the three selector types in order of increasing specificity.
<element>, .class, #id

- Why is using `!important` considered bad practice?
Because !important is used to force styles, which leads to a cascade and specificity wars, making the codebase hard to manage.
