## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
  In TypeScript, a function is a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value. Functions are fundamental building blocks in TypeScript, just like in JavaScript, but they come with additional features for type checking.

- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
  Function Name: Identifies the function. It follows standard naming conventions.
  Parameters: Listed in parentheses, parameters are inputs to the function. In TypeScript, you can specify the type of each parameter.
  Return Type: After the parameters, you can specify the type of value the function will return.
  Function Body: Enclosed in curly braces, this is where the code that executes when the function is called is written.

- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
  Function Name: The name of the function you're calling.
  Arguments: The values you pass to the function's parameters, enclosed in parentheses.

- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
  Purpose: A function definition declares and describes the function, including what it does and what it expects. A function call is an instruction to execute the function.
  Components: A function definition includes parameters and a return type, while a function call includes arguments.
  Execution: The function definition does not execute the code, it merely describes it. A function call actually executes the code in the function.

- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
  Parameter: A parameter is a variable in the declaration of the function. It's like a placeholder for the value that will be passed to the function.
  Argument: An argument is the actual value that you pass to the function when you call it.

- Why are function **parameters** useful?
  Flexibility: They allow functions to operate on different data without changing the function's logic.
  Reusability: You can use the same function in different contexts with different inputs.
  Clarity: They help in understanding what kind of data the function expects.

- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
  Output Value: It specifies the value that will be returned by the function to the caller.
  Terminates Execution: It immediately stops the execution of the function and returns control to the calling context.
