## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is destructuring, conceptually?
Destructuring in JavaScript is a convenient way to extract values from arrays or properties from objects and assign them to variables. Normally, you'd access each property individually. But with object destructuring, you can grab multiple properties in one statement.

- What is the syntax for `Object` destructuring?
const object = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };
const { a, b } = object;


- What is the syntax for `Array` destructuring?
const array = [1, 2, 3];
const [x, y] = array;


- How can you tell the difference between destructuring and creating `Object`/`Array` literals?
Object Destructuring: You'll see it often on the left side of an assignment (=) where the object's keys are in curly braces {} without values.
Array Destructuring: Similar to object destructuring, but for arrays. It uses square brackets [] on the left side of an assignment.
