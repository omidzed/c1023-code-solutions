## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is JSON?
JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It's a format used to store and transport data. JSON is text, but it's structured like a JavaScript object, which makes it really handy for web applications.

- What are serialization and deserialization?
Serialization: This is the process of converting a data structure (like an object or an array in JavaScript) into a format that can be easily stored or transmitted. In the context of JSON, serialization transforms your JavaScript objects into a JSON string. It's like packing your data into a suitcase for a trip.

Deserialization: This is the opposite process. It involves converting data from its stored format (like a JSON string) back into a usable data structure. When you receive a JSON string from a server, for instance, deserialization turns it back into a JavaScript object or array. It's like unpacking your suitcase when you arrive at your destination.

- Why are serialization and deserialization useful?
They are useful for data exchange, storage and because of their cross-language compatibility.

- How do you serialize a data structure into a JSON string using JavaScript?
JSON.stringify()

- How do you deserialize a JSON string into a data structure using JavaScript?
JSON.parse()
