## Notes

Create a way for the search box to look for the letters being typed into it in the list of quotes

Make sure you convert what is being typed in the searchBox to lowercase, so that the it is not case sensitive (per exercise directions)

then limit the amount of quotes being shown to user form the original quotes list based on the searchBox value
