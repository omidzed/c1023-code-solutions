- What is a database schema?
  A database schema is like a blueprint for a database. It defines how data is organized and how the relations among them are associated. It involves tables, views, and other elements. Think of it as the layout of a building, showing where everything is and how it all connects.

- What is a table?
  In a database, a table is a collection of related data held in a structured format within a database. It's like a spreadsheet with rows and columns. Each table has a unique name and consists of rows and columns.

- What is a row?
  A row in a database table is like an individual record. It’s a single entry in the table that contains specific information. Each row holds data for a single entity (like a person, a product, etc.). In a table of customers, for example, each row would represent one customer.
- What is an attribute and what other names are used to describe them?
  An attribute in a database is a piece of information or a characteristic of an entity. It’s a column in a table. Other names for an attribute include "field," "column," or "property." For example, in a table of students, attributes could be student ID, name, age, and so on.
